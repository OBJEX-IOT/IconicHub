## What is OBJEX?
OBJEX is a "startup" maybe (I don't know, it's early to say). 
Currently, it's a set of experimental IoT projects. Every project has a different name, for example, ORB1T.
The goal of OBJEX is to develop IoT systems/devices.

# IconicHub

**Elevator pitch**
Universal control system for RGB LEDs. I2C and SPI Protocol Ready.

### What is it?
This circuit is used to remotely control RGB LEDs. With IconicHub you can control different types of LEDs simultaneously.

### Why I made this?
I designed this circuit to control various types of RGB LEDs, for example WS2812B and APA2020.

### Features

- ESP8266 - 12E
- USB-C TYPE 2.0
- AMS1117-3.3
- BSS138

### Issues
Currently the project has no technical problems.

### The future of IconicHub?
In the future I will continue the project.

**Margins of improvement**

- Add ESP32
- Battery with charging system
